        "This work develops a compact image hash code learning framework based on the COSFIRE filter banks for efficient similarity search and retrieval. Images are first passed through class-specific COSFIRE filters designed to activate on visually discriminative patterns. These feature vectors are input to a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP)  network to learn binary hash codes that should capture the semantic similarity of the images, enabling efficient matching of hash codes of database images for fast retrieval. Our experiments on an image dataset demonstrate the potential of this straightforward approach for developing compact hash codes based rotation-invariant COSFIRE descriptors.  \n",

        "The input data consists of a set of descriptors extracted for each image using COSFIRE filters. Specifically, 50 COSFIRE filters are designed for each image class. When applied to a given image, each COSFIRE filter produces a maximum response value. By concatenating the maximum response across the 50 filters per class, a 200-element descriptor vector is obtained for that image (since there are 4 classes).\n",
        "\n",
        "This process is applied to every image, resulting in a dataframe where each row contains the 200-element descriptor vector corresponding to an image. So each image is represented by a n-dimensional vector (n=200 in this case) of COSFIRE filter response values, which encode visual characteristics that help differentiate between classes.\n",

This serves as the input data capturing image features that will be further transformed into a k-bit hash code for efficient similarity search and retrieval. The compact hash representation helps quickly locate the most similar images from the database given a new query image.\n",
